## üåç What is this project?

Beyond earth is an interactive storytelling website that brings the history of global space exploration to life. Built for the Data Visualization course at EPFL, our project visualizes rocket launches from 1957 to 2039, allowing users to explore how the space race has evolved : from Cold War rivalries to the rise of private spaceflight.

Using interactive maps, contextual timelines, and a game-like interface, users can dive into the who, when, and where of global launches and what they meant in the broader historical picture.


## üí≠ Why?

Space exploration is a story of ambition, rivalry, and innovation. But with thousands of launches across decades, the big picture can get lost. We wanted to create a platform that organizes this complexity into a compelling and immersive experience, where anyone can explore space history at their own pace and curiosity level.

Whether you‚Äôre here for Apollo 11, Elon Musk, or just curious about what the USSR was launching in the 70s, this site is for you.


## üîç Where is the Data From?

We used the Historical Space Launches 1957‚Äì2039 dataset hosted on Hugging Face, originally scraped from [Space Launch Now](https://spacelaunchnow.me). We enriched this data with manual research on historical eras, space agencies, and rocket specs to tell a deeper story.
