Welcome to our Data Visualization project, where we dive into the epic journey of space exploration. Using rich historical data and interactive visuals, our goal is to build a dynamic web experience that reveals how the space race has evolved from 1957 to today‚Äîand into the future.


## üß† Milestones

Check out our [Milestone 1](milestones\milestone1.md) and [Milestone 2](milestones\milestone2.md) reports to follow our progress.

## üåç What‚Äôs this project about?

This project is an interactive storytelling website that brings the history of space launches to life. From the Cold War rivalry to the rise of private space companies, we explore who launched what, when, and where‚Äîand what it all means in the bigger picture.

We use the **Historical Space Launches 1957‚Äì2039** dataset from Hugging Face (originally scraped from [Space Launch Now](https://spacelaunchnow.me)) and supplement it with major historical events to put launches in global context.
