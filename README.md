## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**


### Dataset

> For this project, we will explore the Historical Space Launch Data from Hugging Face's dataset repository, specifically the Historical Space Launches 1957-2039 dataset. This dataset provides detailed information about space missions, including launch names, dates, providers, rocket names, and launch pad locations. The data on Hugging Face was originally scraped from "https://spacelaunchnow.me" some time ago. As a next step, we may consider scraping the site ourselves to obtain the latest launch data. Additionally, we may supplement this dataset with other sources, such as key historical events, to better understand the dynamics of the Space Race and its connections to broader geopolitical events. 


### Problematic

> We aim to visualize the evolution of space exploration from 1957 to 2039, highlighting key milestones in rocket launch history. Our project will showcase how the number of launches and their global distribution across countries and launch providers have changed over time, revealing major breakthroughs and historical events. From the Cold War-era Space Race to the rise of private space companies, we will illustrate how different players have shaped the industry and what this means for the future of space exploration.

> By analyzing launch frequencies, agency activity, and geospatial launch patterns, we will create an interactive visualization that brings space history to life. Our focus includes tracking launch trends over time, comparing government and private agencies, mapping launch sites, and evaluating mission success rates. This project is designed for space enthusiasts, historians, and anyone interested in understanding the transformation of space exploration.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> See notebook provided called "Exploration.ipynb" for some exploratory data analysis.

> A preliminary visualization has also been created, and all code is available on this GitHub. You can access the visualization here: [DataViz Prototype.](https://dataviz-prototype.vercel.app)


### Related work

> The Space Launch Now database is primarily used for a popular mobile application that tracks spaceflight events. Beyond this, there are few public projects that extensively analyze or visualize this dataset. 

> Our approach is therefore original because we aim to combine the Space Launch Now data with key historical events, such as the Cold War and major geopolitical milestones, to uncover patterns in space exploration. Unlike existing visualizations that focus solely on launch tracking, we will create interactive visualizations that highlight the evolution of space agencies, launch trends, and mission success rates over time.

> We used NASA's website and past projects as inspiration. We believe that the space theme offers exciting opportunities for creative visualizations!
